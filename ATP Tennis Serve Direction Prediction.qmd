# Import Data and add Surface Information to Points

Import the specific data that I will be working with.  
In this case, I want data about serving and point basics on a specific surface (hard, clay or grass).
```{r}
matches_men <- read_csv("C:\\Users\\Rino Cattabiani\\Mens Data\\charting-m-matches.csv")
matches_women <- read_csv("C:\\Users\\Rino Cattabiani\\Womens Data\\charting-w-matches.csv")
points_men <- read_csv("C:\\Users\\Rino Cattabiani\\Mens Data\\charting-m-points-2020s.csv")
points_women <- read_csv("C:\\Users\\Rino Cattabiani\\Womens Data\\charting-w-points-2020s.csv")

surface_lookup_men <- matches_men %>%
    select(match_id, Surface) %>%
    rename(surface = Surface)
surface_lookup_women <- matches_women %>%
    select(match_id, Surface) %>%
    rename(surface = Surface)

points_men <- points_men %>% left_join(surface_lookup_men, by = "match_id")
points_women <- points_women %>% left_join(surface_lookup_women, by = "match_id")

cat(sprintf("Loaded %d men's points and %d women's points\n", nrow(points_men), nrow(points_women)))
